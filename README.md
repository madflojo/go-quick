# Health Checks Example - In Go

This project is a base example for an HTTP Hello World service written in Go. What sets this example apart is that it 
emphasizes resiliency features.

Those features are as follows:  

- Liveness probe support via `/health` end-point 
- Readiness probe support via `/ready` end-point 
- Graceful shutdown with SIGTERM signal trap  

TODO:

- Add basic metrics 
- Add tracing via OpenTracing

If you are looking to start a simple Go HTTP service, you could fork this repository and start from there.
